# RPEngine 1.04r (Release Date: Aug. 5, 2015)

3D Rigidbody Physics Engine (CPU-based, Collision-based)

This engine is based on Cyclone Engine ("Ian Millington, Game Physics Engine Development").

1. Purpose

	1.1. For education (physics engine development)

	Referring to this project would be helpful if you are a novice of developing a physics engine. RPEngine can be a good cornerstone of your own engine development.

	1.2. For simple simulations

	RPEngine also provides an extendable framework for various simulations. Whatever you want to simulate, it is easy to implement proper codes by yourself (depending on functional rules/policies).
